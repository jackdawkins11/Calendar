![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackdawkins11/calendar/master/img/screenshot.png)

This is a fully functional calendar website.

### Features

* User accounts
* Create events with the "New" button
* Display other account's events by typing their name under "Meet with..."
* Change the displayed week using the calendar in the upper-left corner
* Click on events to view their details

### Hosting it yourself

It uses PHP and MySQL for the backend. If you have a PHP and MySQL server set up, you can set it up like this:

* Clone the repository to your server
* Put valid values into ```$dbusername```, ```$dbpassword``` and ```dbhost``` in config.php
* Run the command ```php install.php```

After that you should be able to start creating accounts and events.
