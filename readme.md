![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackdawkins11/calendar/master/img/screenshot.png)

This is a simple calendar website with a super simple backend.

The main focus was about creating a nice UI. I basically copied the design from google calendar.

### Functionality:

You can make an account and then create and delete events as well as view every other accounts events.
